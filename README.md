pySPEC is a platform-independent graphical user-interface written in Python 3 for spectroscopy with the TCD1304. Originally developed by [Esben Rossel](https://tcd1304.wordpress.com) for general-purpose data acquisition with the TCD1304 linear CCD sensor, it has been modified by [Adrian Matsch](https://www.astrolens.net) to specifically support spectroscopy applications.

## Installation

On Windows, download and run the installer from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/iqnite/pyccd-spectrometer/releases/latest) page.

On other platforms, ensure you have Python 3 and the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can run the application using:

```bash
python main.pyw
```
